Small reddit sentiment analysis python program. It uses the AI model trained on 50M+ Twitter posts, RoBERTA.

This is my first GitHub repository and probably has quite a few issues. The code is all there though and should be useful for someone trying to do something similar.
This code needs to be run on Python 3.11 along with TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Let me know if there are any suggestions!
